# Conjoinment
A Crazy-Cut Game written in Elm.

*A Work in Progress*

Written in a few days to learn Elm.  
See it in action [here](http://adishavit.github.io/Conjoinment/).   
The current project generates nested conjoined-twin polygons that the user is challenged to separate.

There is so much more that can be done, such as:
 - Prevent self-intersecting polygons and twins
 - More complex edge alteration, e.g. with twists;
 - Smart alteration that preserves gradients along seam joint.

Inspired by ["Crazy-Cuts: From Theory to App", Yotam Elor, Doron Shaked, and Alfred M. Bruckstein](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~freddy/papers/144.pdf)
